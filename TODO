* Create a user function that makes a superuser if no users exist; otherwise, create a regular user with a user-defined password.
* Create a exception handler so api is consistent
* Fix configs.py so half present configs are not overwritten
* Optional: (Implement a self made dictionary checker - optimal for configs.py overwriting issue as well as solves inconsistant response of incorrect params)
