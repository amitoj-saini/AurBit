# Aurbit

## The private tracking instance for your personal and business needs.

Aurbit is designed with your privacy and control in mind. In a world where data is often taken without permission, Aurbit empowers you to take back control by providing a secure, self-hosted tracking solution — no middlemen, no data mining.

### Why Aurbit?

- **Your Data, Your Rules:** All data is stored securely on your own server or device. You decide who has access.

- **Easy to Use:** We’re building Aurbit to be accessible and user-friendly, so going private won’t mean complexity or headaches.
